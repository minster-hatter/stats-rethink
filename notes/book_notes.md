# Notes from Statistical Rethinking (2nd Edition).

## Chapter 1.
The book is outlined. Statistical models are first compared to golems (they do exactly as told, regardless of what is actually intended). The dominant paradigm of falsification is the described, along with how this book relates to it and its criticisms. For example, models and hypotheses are not the same thing, and data may not be comprehensive. What will follow later in the book is trailed, along with key themes that recur (*e.g.*, hierarchical models and DAGs).

## Chapter 2.
The idea of small- and large-world models is introduced (along the lines of a simplified model "reality" and the more complex world the model tries to describe). Bayesian probability is then introduced through the example of counting the outcome(s) of drawing coloured marbles from a bag. Next, a model for the amount of water that covers Earth is developed (see earth_water). This is then used to introduce the components of models and also how to fit them, including MCMC.
