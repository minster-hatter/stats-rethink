# Notes from Statistical Rethinking (2nd Edition).

## Chapter 1.
The book is outlined. Statistical models are first compared to golems (they do exactly as told, regardless of what is actually intended). The dominant paradigm of falsification is the described, along with how this book relates to it and its criticisms. For example, models and hypotheses are not the same thing, and that data may not be comprehensive. What will follow later in the book is trailed, along with key themes that recur (*e.g.*, hierarchical models and DAGs).
